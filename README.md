# TimeTrace GUI
## Motivation
Timetrace (https://github.com/dominikbraun/timetrace) is an excellent cli tool for keeping track of time spent on various projects. However, if you are working on a restricted corporate network that does not permit the installation of software, it is difficult to use, especially if said network also restricts outgoing connections so that you cannot ssh to a machine which has timetrace installed.

One option would be to run timetrace in termux (https://github.com/termux/termux-app) on your phone, but I decided to build a front end to timetrace that can be accessed from a web browser.
